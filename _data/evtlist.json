        "about": "As part of Megathon`17, we introduced a social challenge which was around Women Safety and Cyber Crime. Although it was limited only to Hyderabad students, we were really inspired by the innovative solutions that were proposed. Motivated by the success last year and a deep desire to take it to national level, we decided to take the same problem, which still remains one of the most pressing issues of today.\n\n In this edition, we are looking for all kinds of solution (and not just limited to technology) that could be useful to address this problem. The whole idea behind this is to find solutions that can be implemented and/or taken to the market. Hence, we shall be partnering with different govt. agencies (like the Hyderabad Police She Team) and NGOs who shall help us in this aspect.\n\n We really want to make our small contribution to this important issue and hope for a safer nation for women.",
